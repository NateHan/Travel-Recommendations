### Classics

Chicago is known for Deep-Dish pizza, loaded hotdogs and Italian Beef. I posit that there are also 2 new not-to-be-missed players that should be considered in this scene: Doughnuts and Burgers.

#### **Deep-Dish**

Truly a "pizza pie". If done right, it takes about 30-45 min to make from time of order. If you like spicy things, getting spicy giardinera (crunchy pickled veggies) as a topping is a lifehack. Here's a few of my favorites, ranked in order of preference. 

- <ins>Peaquod's</ins>: Their specialty is that they carmelize the crust. I think their ingredients are also very fresh and make a difference. It's near Lincoln Park, about a 20 minute drive from downtown.
- <ins>Art of Pizza</ins>: Hole in the wall joint with several locations that has great "by the slice" options, no waiting here.
- <ins>Lou Malnati's</ins>: A local chain, but reliably good. Get the sausage - they put a thin layer that covers the entire pizza rather than the "meatball" style. Get a butter crust upgrade for added decadence!
- <ins>Gino's East/Pizzeria Uno/Pizzeria Duo</ins>: Also local chains, but all downtown locations and are decent entries. I haven't been in a while so I can't vouch but hear good things. 
- _Avoid_: Giordano's. Local chain but quality isn't great.

#### **Hot Dogs and Italian Beef**

The two couldn't be more different, but where you can get one, you can usually also get the other, so I'm combining their locations. 

**Chicago Style Hotdog**: a loaded, yet perfectly balanced vehicle for encased meat. Get it with everything - but beware the neon green relish isn't for everyone, you won't offend anyone by having things removed. Don't put ketchup on it, you may get literally yelled at. In fact, if the restaurant _won't_ yell at you for requesting ketchup on the dog, it's a bad sign. Also get it with fries, the great places wrap the fries up _with_ the dog. Any hole-in-the-wall place that looks like it was made in the 60's and hasn't been updated since is a great option. If it has survived this long, that means it's great.

**Italian Beef**:  The classic juicy, messy sandwich. The authentic route is to get it "dipped" in the au-jus that they have the beef in, though it's an option. You'll also have the option for sweet or hot peppers, and sometimes cheese. The cheese is going overboard in my opinion, but sometimes that craving hits you.

- <ins>Portillo's</ins>: Iconic local chain with a downtown location and you can't go wrong. They also have good Italian Beef. Their chocolate cake is also worthwhile. Lots of people like the Chocolate Cake Shake but I think it just clogs up the straw and is weird when the cake is that mushy.
- <ins>Al's beef</ins>: Another iconic local chain with locations throughout the city, simple menu, can't go wrong. The fries are better than Portillo's if I recall. 
- <ins>The Weiner Circle</ins>: A classic unassuming spot by day, an... experience by night after a certain hour, especially on the weekends. Search on Youtube for some examples, be warned, likely NSFW. 


#### **Doughnuts**

This is personal opinion, but Chicago deserves more credibility for how good they are here. Other cities just don't do them as well. Lots of doughnut shops have started to spring up here, but the ones that set themselves ahead of the curve are the ones that do simple well. There's a lot of gimmicky doughnuts out there, don't fall for it. For most of these places, you have to get there early to have the best selection.


- <ins>The Doughnut Vault</ins>: Tied for 1st place as far as "best" .Small place downtown that has incredible simple doughnuts. The chestnut flavor sounds out of left field but is top-notch. More likely to sell out earlier in the day and will close based on whenever they do, so go there early in the morning if possible.
- <ins>Do-Rite Doughnuts and Chicken</ins>: Also tied for 1st place for "best". A bigger doughnut so you can't have as many (up to you...), but still top notch. Their chicken is also very good, they have good lunch sandwiches. Get both for a well-rounded meal, and find a place for a nap after. They have many locations throughout the city, all serve the same quality stuff. They are stocked all day, but lose variety the later it gets. 
- <ins>Firecakes</ins>: Another good downtown spot, stays open pretty late with good variety
- <ins>_Avoid_: Stan's</ins>: Imported California trash. The glitter of doughnuts - all showy flavors, terrible quality. I literally get sick after having one. New locations popping up like fungus. 

#### **Burgers**

Also a less-known player on the Chicago food scene, but this city does them _very_ well.

- <ins>Au Cheval</ins>: Often rated as one of the best burgers in the country. Simple burger with an egg on it with great quality. Be warned - they don't take reservations, and wait times can be 2+ hours at prime time. Get there right when they open (5ish?) or  it's downtown adjacent - so a tip is to go put your name in, then grab a cocktail/drinks at a nearby bar that are plentiful near its only location. 
- <ins>Small Cheval</ins>: A fast-casual version of the primetime location. They only serve 3 things on the menu, and they're all good. Somewhat pricey for fast-casual, but worth it!
- <ins>Kuma's</ins>: A death-metal themed bar with creative, gigantic burgers. It used to be THE best, but since it expanded it has dropped a bit in quality. Still good and noteworthy, and a fun experience, if you're in to the "alt" scene. The music will be loud, and campy horror movies are often playing on TV's throughout the bar. Don't sleep on the mac and cheese.
- <ins>The Loyalist</ins>: a fancy restaurant that serves tons of other pricey stuff, but their burger is all I care about - I have no idea if the other food is good or not...

### Other Great Eats

#### Downtown/River North

- <ins>Ramen-San</ins>: quality Ramen spot with a fun vibe
- <ins>Quartino Restaurant</ins>: reasonably priced, unassuming Italian food with unexpectedly fantastic quality.
- <ins>Ema</ins>: Creative and tasty mediterranean small-plates. They had a lunch hot-bar back in the day that was also fantastic, not sure if it is running post-COVID...
- <ins>Miller's Pub</ins>: classic Chicago art-deco dinner spot in the heart of the loop that has been around forever. Has a large menu with traditional American pub fare, nothing fancy, but fun.

#### River West/Fulton Market 

Hip/trendy and downtown adjacent neigborhood. Defiitely head over here to escape the "tourist central" vibe of downtown if you're pressed for time. 

- <ins>Ramen Takeya</ins> : Same owners as Ramen Wasabi. Wasabi is still the best, but this gives it a run for its money. Don't skip the pork bao's and the brussel sprouts
- <ins>Green Street Smoked Meats</ins> : Best BBQ I've had outside of Texas. You order at a counter and the bar inside is a cool hangout spot.

#### Not-downtown

- <ins>Wasabi</ins>: The best Ramen I've ever had, located in Logan Square. They have other similar but different locations in River West and Lincoln Square now. The pork buns and brussel sprouts are also killer appetizer options.
- <ins>Cho Sun Ok</ins>: Incredible Korean BBQ in Lincoln Square (BYOB). Small place, you may wait in a line for 20-45 min, outside (Winter beware). It's always slammed, and the servers aren't there to coddle you. You're not going to get comedically harassed a la Ed Debevek's/Dick's Last Resort, but don't be put off if the servers aren't buddy-buddy.
- <ins>Virtue</ins>: Upscale soul food in Hyde Park. All creative but tasty comfort food, and ends up just being a fun meal, especially if your group is in to sharing items. 
- <ins>Spacca Napoli</ins>: Very good neopolitan style thin crust pizza in Ravenswood. 
- <ins>Flying Saucer</ins>: A creative brunch spot in Logan Square/Humboldt Park. Vegan/Veggie friendly. They have a creative menu, but also have plenty of breakfast classics. Their specialty is their breakfast bowls which range from healthy-ish to heart clogging. You may have to wait 20-40 min on the weekend and it's small, so that wait may be outside.
- <ins>Lula Cafe</ins>: Slightly upscale brunch spot in Logan Square. Stephanie and I have a personal fondness for this place, but can say the food is always very tasty, whether its their creative dishes or the staples. It's bigger and the inside is gorgeous. Again a wait is likely on a weekend, but that wait will be inside if you'd like. A bonus is they'll serve you coffee while you wait (or at least they used to). The area it's in is fun to stroll around if the wait is long. 

## Drinks

#### Downtown/River North

- <ins>Three Dots and a Dash</ins>: Chicago-famous tiki bar. Make a reservation ahead of time or go early (earlier than 5pm) to get a seat at the bar.
- <ins>Cindy's Rooftop</ins>: Amazing views and pricey but decent cocktails. I've heard the food is really good, but you need a reservation far in advance. Bar is walk-up though.
- <ins>Chicago Athletic Club</ins> - Same building as Cindy's but slightly less fancy. Cozy vibe with a fun "game room" (Bacci, darts, pool, etc) area in the back that can be hoppin at happy hours or weekends. 
- <ins>Cherry Circle Room</ins> - Madmen-esque era speakeasy lounge in the back of the Chicago Athletic Club. Known for their various Old Fashioned's. A bit pricey but also serves great food. Can get a slightly pricey burger and some apps, or really go for it with $$$ steaks. 

#### River West/Fulton Market

- <ins>The Aviary</ins>: a cocktail version of the only 3 Michelin Star Restaurnt in town. Interesting mixes with an emphasis on presentation. Need a reservation, can probably do 1 week out for non-primetime days, longer for weekends. Pricey, individual cocktails are $25-40ish, or they have a 3-drink prix-fixe for $75.
- <ins>Booze Box/Sushi Dokku</ins>: Speakesy entrance in an alley, but the restaurant has a regular street-entrance. Very good drinks and very good sushi. You need a reservation but if you don't mind sitting at the bar something usually opens up quickly.


#### Others
- <ins>The Violet Hour</ins>: Wicker Park speakeasy. This is one of my favorites, can be tough to get in - and tough to find. The entrance is unassuming
